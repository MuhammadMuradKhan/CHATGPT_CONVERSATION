This paper addresses the security problem in the identification of FIR (Finite Impulse Response) systems with binary-valued observations when the data is under DoS attacks in the process of transmission. From the attacker’s point of view, the optimal attack strategy to maximize the estimation error is given, where the attack is constrained by the average and the maximum energies. From the defender’s point of view, the encryption-type defense scheme is proposed, and the sufficient and necessary conditions are given to make the algorithm consistent. The effectiveness of the conclusion is verified by numerical simulation. Finally, the correctness of the obtained conclusion is verified by numerical simulation.'})
